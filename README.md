# IF2210 Object Oriented Programming Course Project
## Card Games Simulator
This repository contains a C++ program that simulates popular card games such as Poker, Cangkul, and 24 Card. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of object-oriented programming principles and as a completion of [Bandung Institute of Technology](https://www.itb.ac.id/) IF2210 Object-Oriented Programming course project.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run this program, you will need a Linux OS with the G++ compiler and makefile installed. We recommend using WSL with Ubuntu distribution as it has been tested on such environment.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/AlifioDitya/TubesOOP_KYS.git
    ```
2. Create a `bin` folder at the root
    ``` bash
    mkdir bin
    ```
3. Navigate to the `src` folder
    ``` bash
    cd src
    ```
4. Compile the program using the makefile
    ``` bash
    make all
    ```

### Usage
To run the program, compile the program and navigate to the `bin` folder. Execute the following command:
``` bash
./game.out
```
You will be prompted to choose which card game to simulate. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

### Cleaning Up
To remove residual object codes, navigate to the `src` folder and execute the following command:
``` bash
make clean
```
